# About This File

It was created by Apple Inc. for tvOS beta and iOS beta.

The reason this works is because the profile you just installed actually enrolls your device into another platform's beta program. Your device will now go looking for a compatible version of let's say iOS but your device now can only find tvOS betas, it will assume no update is available and as such, not offer one. It’s a workaround of sorts, and it’s very effective. Should you want to update iOS at a later date, simply removing the profile and restarting should do the trick, so it’s a completely reversible process, too.
